# :rocket: Features

<p>ðŸ”¥ Next Level Week is a free online event produced by Rocketseat. For 5 days, a teacher shows how to build a complete application from scratch.
The NLW 3 proposal is an application in which orphanages can register, and people can schedule visits to play with the children. </p>

<p> I have then redesigned Happy into Sants, an animal sanctuary platform that will bring people together with rescued animals. People looking for 
animal sanctuaries can find them close to them, but also sanctuaries can register themselves to receive the public.
